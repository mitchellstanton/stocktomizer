stock price movements
This repository archives an evolving project intended for developing an experimental investment stategy: 
1) identifying stocks that have favorable month to month price movements using machine learning
2) visualizing price movements 
3) identify entry and exit points

Notes:
RE: 1) price movements are determined by changes in each month's closing price
RE: 2) price movements are visualized in different graphical structures
RE: 3) entry and exit points are not yet objectively determined 
RE: 4) financial data was retrieved from Alpha Vantage

Additionally, I have attempted to implement tidyverse methodology in structuring R scripts.

This is an on-going project.
