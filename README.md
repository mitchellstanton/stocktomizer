# stocktomizer

This repository archives an evolving project intended for developing an experimental investment stategy: 
1) identifying stocks that have favorable month to month price movements using machine learning
2) visualizing price movements 
3) identify entry and exit points

Notes:
1) price movements are determined by changes in each month's closing price
2) price movements are visualized in different graphical structures
3) entry and exit points are not yet objectively determined 
4) financial data was retrieved from Alpha Vantage
5) I have attempted to implement tidyverse methodology in structuring R scripts.
6) This is an on-going project.
